RPSContest
==========

A contest environment for Rock-Paper-Scissors. Originally designed to play the Morple (https://github.com/dabbler0/Morple) against Zfeng (https://github.com/weihang7/Zfeng).
Contestants should accept the opponent's last move as standard input, and output their moves as standard output in single characters ('R', 'P', or 'S').
